    <li>2 cups long-grain parboiled rice</li>
    <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
    <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
    <li>2-3 tomatoes, blended or 1 can of tomato paste</li>
    <li>2-3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ginger, grated</li>
    <li>1-2 Scotch bonnet peppers (optional for heat)</li>
    <li>2 cups chicken or vegetable broth</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon thyme</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Fresh parsley or cilantro for garnish (optional)</li>

</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Follow these steps to prepare delicious Jollof rice:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Set aside to drain.</li>
    <li>In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until translucent.</li>
    <li>Add the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for another minute until fragrant.</li>
    <li>Add the blended tomatoes or tomato paste, red and green bell peppers, and Scotch bonnet peppers (if using). Cook for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens and the oil begins to separate from the tomato mixture.</li>
    <li>Add the thyme, curry powder, salt, and pepper to the sauce. Stir well to combine.</li>
    <li>Add the drained rice to the pot, stirring to coat the rice with the tomato sauce.</li>
    <li>Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 20-30 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and has absorbed all the liquid. Avoid lifting the lid too often to prevent steam from escaping.</li>
    <li>Once the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.</li>
    <li>Garnish with fresh parsley or cilantro if desired. Serve hot with your choice of protein or side dishes.</li>
</ol>

<b>Additional Tips:</b>
<i>
<ul>
    <li>For extra flavor, you can add a bay leaf or smoked paprika to the sauce.</li>
    <li>If you prefer a smokier taste, you can cook the rice over low heat for a few extra minutes to create a slightly crispy bottom layer, known as "party rice."</li>
    <li>Feel free to customize the recipe by adding vegetables like peas, carrots, or corn for added texture and nutrition.</li>
    <li>Leftover Jollof rice can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and reheated on the stovetop or in the microwave.</li>
